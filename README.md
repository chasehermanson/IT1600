# Hosting Code to AWS Server Via FileZilla
### Created by Chase Hermanson (Cmhvz6)

## This tutorial will show the basics steps that are necessary to take in order to house your HTML/CSS code to a AWS server. FileZilla will be used as the transfer system between your local system and your server.
## The inteneded audience would be early year web devolopers who have basic AWS and terminal experience. As long as they have been exposed to basic IT/CS technology, they should have no problem setting the connection. They may not have the HTML/CSS to have anything populated to the HTML server, but at least the connection between the local host and AWS server will be there.
